# Hyper Sonic for Sonic Battle

Hyper Sonic is a work-in-progress demo patch for Sonic Battle (US) demonstrating SBP files and their capabilities. It also uses SBHS.

It replaces Sonic with Hyper Sonic who has various increased stats and similar.

It's made with sprites that are made by shadow_91 and Joe TE with ripped sprites by Nate The Hedgehog.

Due to current circumstances (ie I haven't asked them whether I'm able to distribute the sprites yet) the sheet is not included in the repository. However, you can see the frames below and that can be used to recreate the sheet.

Without sprites, you'll encounter *a lot* of empty frames (As seen under original sprite, those gaps *are not mistakes, they are sprites not present in the original game.*).
